**Introduction**     
AggieMe is an all-in-one personal app that allows users to easily access UC Davis facilities. The app contains a unique QR code for each user that represents the Userâ€™s ID. This way, with a simple scan of an app users can enter any facility. 

Furthermore, the app is a social media app that allows for easy interactions with users with similar interests, etc. In a sense, this is an all-in-one UC Davis app!


**Project Basics**

The app is composed of 5 pages: launch, login, register, QR code, and personal information. The launch page greets users and redirects them to the registration page to create a new account or the login page for existing users to sign in. The QR code page contains the code to be scanned. The personal information page allows users to fill in info such as name, email, social media, etc. We used React Native to design the front end.
